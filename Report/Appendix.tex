This Gaant diagram has been realized at the middle of the week and show what remains to be done in order to implement a solution to the project. I let at least 3 days to test the seam carving algorithm on the signals in order to find if the results are relevant. They are some other algorithms that can be used but they will be implemented if this one doesn't work.

The program which has been used in order to generate this diagram is \textbf{MindView 6.0}

For this part, most of the tools come from those references \cite{Doopler1} \cite{Doopler2} \cite{Doopler3}.
\textbf{For now, I'm still working on this part so I will complete this part as soon as I get result.}
The main purpose of this article is to present an algorithm which allow us to find the speed of an object thanks to the Doppler effect but it can be use here in order to find the frequency laws which compose the signal. With this, we have a way to find correlation between the electromagnetic signature and the kind of from changes of an object.


\chapter{Application on our project}

We will now apply this algorithm to the time frequency representation coming from the part 2 and from the signal generate in the part 1.

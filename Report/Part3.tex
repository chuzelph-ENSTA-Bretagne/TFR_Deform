\medskip

The last part of the work is to find a method in order to have the expression of the signal's law frequency. Find an analytic expression seems pretty complicated but find first the value of the instantaneous frequency at a moment given and then realize an interpolation is far more simple. Furthermore, we can hope to find correlation between the result of the interpolation and the kind of movement or deformation we are studying.

The first part will present a way to find the frequency law of a signal, how we can realize the interpolation and the result that can be expected.

\medskip

\section{Presentation of the algorithm.}


At the beginning, the seam carving algorithm is used in order to reduce the size of an image and keep some proportion of the image. The main idea of this algorithm is to find the path in an image which have the least importance and automatically remove them in order to resize the image \cite{avidan2007seam}.

The following figure show what kind of result can be expected and the different step of the algorithm:

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Example of the seam carving algorithm, coming from the website \textit{http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse557/08wi/projects/final/artifacts.html}.}
    \label{fig:ankit-rahul}
\end{figure}


Nevertheless, it can be used in this project in order to find a approximation of the frequency law which compose a signal. In the time frequency representation, the different laws which compose the signal represent a path in the image and we can use this algorithm in order to find an empiric expression $f(t)$.
The main purpose of those articles \cite{barnwal2013doppler} \cite{couvreur1997doppler} \cite{cevher2009vehicle} is to present how this algorithm can be implement in order to find the speed of an object thanks to the Doppler effect but it can be use here in order to find the frequency laws which compose the signal. 

The seam carving algorithm can be express by the following line:

	 	\STATE $i++$
	\ENDWHILE 
	
	
  return $k$

\end{algorithm}

\section{Application on a Doppler signal.}

We can apply easily this algorithm on a Doppler signal. Let suppose that an object is moving toward an observer and it is sending a wave (sound for example). The frequency of the signal is changed because of the movement of this object. The following figure shows how the signal is affected by the movement:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6,angle=0]{Images/doopler_signal.png}
    \caption{Time representation and instantaneous frequency of the signal send.}
    \label{fig:doopler_signal}
\end{figure}

The next figure show the time-frequency representation of the signal:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6,angle=0]{Images/doopler_signal_spec.png}
    \caption{Time/Frequency representation of the signal send.}
    \label{fig:doopler_signal_spec}
\end{figure}

Thanks to some tools coming from the image processing, we can improve this result in order to keep only the relevant points which contain information:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6,angle=0]{Images/varseuil_signal.png}
    \caption{Time/Frequency representation of the signal send after treatment.}
    \label{fig:varseuil_signal}
\end{figure}

Finally, when we use the seam carving algorithm, we achieve to get this result:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6,angle=0]{Images/doopler_signal_esti.png}
    \caption{Time/Frequency representation of the signal send after treatment.}
    \label{fig:doopler_signal_spec}
\end{figure}

The last part is to use interpolation algorithm such as fit spline interpolation in order to find an approximation of the law found. The following figure shows how the fit spline interpolation can provide some results:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35,angle=0]{Images/spline_pour_la_loi_de_frequence_trouvee.png}
    \caption{Spline interpolation result. In green the value of the interpolation and in blue the value of the law found}
    \label{fig:spline_pour_la_loi_de_frequence_trouvee}
\end{figure}

Nevertheless, the result given by this method can be disturbed by the beginning of the signal, the kind of signal we are studying and the the parameters of the function, especially the size of the smoothing windows which is use by the function. For example, the following figure shows how these parameters can impact the interpolation.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6,angle=0]{Images/spline_pour_la_loi_de_frequence_trouvee2.png}
    \caption{Spline interpolation with bad result. In green the value of the interpolation and in blue the value of the law found}
    \label{fig:spline_pour_la_loi_de_frequence_trouvee2}
\end{figure}

As the different part have shown, we have now all the tools needed in order to create and then analyse any kind of signal, including the signal details in the introduction.

\chapter{Application to our project.}

In this part, we will apply all the result of the previous part in order to analyse understand the signal generate by the cylinder as it was explain in the introduction.

\section{A first application.}

Let consider a cylinder which \textbf{radius don't change through time} but it's moving according to the following figure.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6,angle=0]{Images/Position.png}
    \caption{First situation studied. The object is moving linearly.}
    \label{fig:moving linearly}
\end{figure}

The following figure shows the spectrogram obtain after we analyse the signal without its means.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6,angle=0]{Images/SpectrogramObjMov.png}
    \caption{Spectrogram of an object moving linearly.}
    \label{fig:SpectrogramObjMov}
\end{figure}

And this figure show the result of the seam carving algorithm:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6,angle=0]{Images/SpectrogramObjMov_LawFound.png}
    \caption{Seam carving application.}
    \label{fig:SpectrogramObjMov_LawFound}
\end{figure}

As you can see, we are in the same configuration as the Doppler signal we have studied in the previous part. There is a frequency which value received by the observer is disturbed by the movement. Futhermore, the seam carving apply perfectly to this kind of figure as the figure \label{SpectrogramObjMov_LawFound} shows it.

\section{Application in view to a verification in the anechoic chamber.}

The school ENSTA Bretagne has a anechoic chamber in which we can simulate the field generate and scatter by object but we can only give a circular movement to those object. Thanks to the code we have created, we know that the wave scatter and it's time frequency representation will be:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35,angle=0]{Images/TFR3.png}
    \caption{Time frequency representation of a cylinder with a circular movement.}
    \label{fig:TFR3}
\end{figure}

The partial sinusoid we can see in this time frequency representation is conformed to the theory but the signal contains too much energy when it's close to the observer which explains why we don't see all the curve.

Thanks to this code, we can generate easily any signal for any object and we can check if the theoretical results are corroborated by the experimental results.

\section{Application to object which form change through time.}

According to the document coming from the supervisors, if we consider a single cylinder which form change through time but is still at the same position. We should get time-frequency representation like this one \cite{Analysis}:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6,angle=0]{Images/TFRExpected.png}
    \caption{Time frequency representation expect. The frequency received have a periodic behaviour.}
    \label{fig:TFRExpected}
\end{figure}

In this article, the authors have studied a similar problem where they analyse the wave reflected by the sea surface. The figure \ref{fig:TFRExpected} which represent the Time-frequency representation of the wave scatter is logical beacause the phenomenon is periodic. Nevertheless, even with a lot of test, we only get result like this one for the problem we are studying:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6,angle=0]{Images/Objx3y10.png}
    \caption{Time-frequency representation of a cylinder with a sinusoidal variation of its radius.}
    \label{fig:Objx3y10}
\end{figure}

As you can see, we have the fundamental and the harmonic of the original signal which are present in this time frequency representation. But the form changing seems to don't have impact on those law frequency during time. Many things can explain this result:

\begin{itemize}
\item The frequency windows is either too big or too small in order to see this phenomenon.
\item We need do analyse a smaller signal and take small windows in order to treat a tiny part of the signal and see this variation.
\item The other parameters which are use for the time-frequency representation aren't adapted and has to be changed.
\end{itemize}


\part{Conclusion}

\bigskip

In the end, all the different part which have been realized during this project very good result.

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
\item One program can generate any signal and also simulate its movement. In the end, we can get the position of the object and of the observer, the field scattered and the filed incident during the simulation.
\item One program shows how we can use all the different time-frequency representation thanks to the tftb library.
\item One last program explain how we can use all the tools developed in the part 3 for any kind of signal.
\end{itemize}

\medskip

All the processing chain wanted in the beggining of the project is working as the different figures \label{TFR3} and \label{SpectrogramObjMov} show it and is provide in \textbf{Python} language. 
Nevertheless, the fact that the impact of the variation of the radius of the cylinder have not been seen is unfortunate.

It provide a lot of information about how to use the code with a README, different script which can be use in order to generate easily some signals and see the different time-frequency representation resulting.

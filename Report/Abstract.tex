This report has been made for the project TFR Deform which its purpose was to create a processing chain in order to analyse the electromagnetic field of object which its form change trough time. According to the recommendation of the supervisors, this project has considered only cylinder which its radius change through time. The deliverable wanted was:

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
\item Create a script which can provide the field scatter by the cylinder, the incident wave and all the geometric parameters of the simulation.
\item Implement or use different time frequency representation in order to see the modification of the electromagnetic signature of the object through time.
\item Implement methods in order to interpolate the law frequency of the electromagnetic signature and, if there was enough time, find correlation between those modifications and the deformation of those objects.
\end{itemize}

\medskip

In the end, the code for the generation of signal is working very well and, even if we implemented our own functions for the time frequency representation at the beginning of the project, we found a library which provide the same functions with a lot of other tools which provide a lot of help during the project. The modelization of the movement is also working and provide excellent result. Nevertheless, \textbf{A completer ABSOLUMENT}
